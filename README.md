Third portfolio project
A Skillcrush course sequence taught students HTML/CSS/Github.  For the course, I designed a static website portfolio based upon their design.  
My finished project is included in this repository. I also have two more portfolio repositories I designed using Skillcrush images.
In all, I coded four static websites and now can design in HTML/CSS a layout using floats. To see my other static designs checkout repositories jubilee-demo, minimal, rogue pickings, 
vision board, and analogous. For more information on Skillcrush go to skillcrush.com.
