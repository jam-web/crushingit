# crushingit
Third portfolio project

crushingit is a design taught in the Skillcrush HTML/CSS/Github curriculum.  For the course, I designed a static website portfolio based upon their design.  
My finished project is included in this repository. I also have two more portfolio repositories I designed using Skillcrush images.
In all, I coded five static websites primarily using floats for the layout. To see my other static designs checkout repositories jubilee-demo, minimal, rogue pickings, vision board, and analogous. For more information on Skillcrush online coding courses, go to skillcrush.com.
