# crushingit
Third portfolio project

Crushingit is a website design taught in the Skillcrush HTML/CSS/Github curriculum.  For the course, I designed a static website portfolio based upon their design.  
My finished project is included in this repository. I also have two more portfolio repositories I designed using Skillcrush images.

In all, I coded five static websites, primarily using floats for the layout, in four months. To see my other static one page designs checkout repositories jubilee-demo, minimal, rogue pickings, vision board, and analogous.
