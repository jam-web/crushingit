# crushingit
Third portfolio project

Crushingit is a website design taught in the Skillcrush HTML/CSS/Github curriculum. My finished project is included in this repository.

Within four months, I coded five static one-page websites, primarily using floats for the layout. To view my other static one page designs checkout repositories jubilee-demo, minimal, rogue pickings, vision board, and analogous.
